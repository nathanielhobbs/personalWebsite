           <h1 style="text-align:center;"> About </h1>
           <p> I've been playing around with Arduino and ESP8266 (a microcontroller and WiFi chip) to build a device that can measure, display, and report plant information.</p>
           <p> Here is a picture of one of the units. All together there are five lights (three green, one yellow, and one red) which light up depending on the moisture level of the soil. There is an additional blue light that will flash when the device is successfully connected to the web server (the "My Garden" above) for sending updates over the internet.</p>

           <p> Here is a picture of one of the devices with the soil moisture sensor attached:</p>

           <p> Here is a picture of a plant on my balcony, a "Money Tree", or pachira aquatica, that is one of the plants I'm monitoring.</p>

           <p> And finally this is what it looks like in action:</p>

           <p> This all was a project I started in 2016 and continues today.  I am working on connnecting a water pump to the devices so that they may automatically water my plants when necessary.  There's also improvements to the "My Garden" interface I'd like to add including adding the ability to reconfigure the devices remotely; right now everything is hard coded.  This would also make it easier to set different watering schedules for different plants (e.g. some plants like more water, so the water level lights and pump would be more sensitive to drops in soil moisture.)</p>
